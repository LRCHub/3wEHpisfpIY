```
It's not a game
I'm not a robot, AI challenging you
I'm not a phantom
I'm in your face and I'm here to see it through
Right before your eyes, watch us multiply
Come to claim our rights, it's time
As our power grows, tryin' to stop us shows
(You) might as well go try'n stop time
So you know that we're out there
Swatting lies in the making
Can't move fast without breaking
Can't hold on or life won't change
And our voices ring out, yeah
Took the mask off to feel free
Fought it out in the debris
Now, we know that life will change
Ain't it a shame
I'm not a figment of your ailing old mind
I'm just as real and
I'm just as dangerous as you, so know you'll find
A taste of your own meds, fire in every breath
Fight inside your head, your heart
And as your crippled brain tries to fight in vain
Your empire will fall apart
And you'll know we were out there
Swatted lies in the making
Your empire for the taking
Can't hold on or life won't change
And our voices rang out, yeah
Took the mask off to feel free
Fought it out in the debris
Now, we know that life will change
